2024: Abundances of trace constituents in Jupiter's atmosphere inferred from Herschel/PACS observations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We inferred the chemical composition of Jupiter's troposphere, the part of the atmosphere where the visible ocher clouds reside, from FIR spectra observed with PACS onboard Herschel. The observations show numerous spectral features caused by ammonia, phosphine, methane and deuterated hydrogen in Jupiter (see right Figure below). While all of these molecules have been detected in Jupiter in similar quantities before, our analysis of the Herschel observations suggests a faster depletion of phosphine out of the upper troposphere than what has been measured before. In Jupiter, phosphine gets transported from the deep to the observable atmosphere by vertical mixing, but there, it quickly gets dissociated by Solar radiation. Our analysis suggests that the PACS observations are especially sensitive to dry parts of Jupiter’s atmosphere that are poor in clouds and provide less shelter for phosphine against photodissociation. Thus, our finding might be especially important for these regions of the Jovian atmosphere.  
In addition to presenting new constraints on the detected molecules' abundances in Jupiter, we can rule out the presence of hydrogen halides at the highest confidence yet. It has been suggested that these halides react with ammonia which is abundant in Jupiter’s troposphere to solid ammonium salts and our new constraints support this picture.
