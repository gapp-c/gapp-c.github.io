PhD student at the Department for Atmospheric Physics of Exoplanets (APEx) at MPIA, Heidelberg, Germany

My research focusses on the observational characterization of (exo-)planets' atmospheres aiming to unravel the strange atmospheric dynamics and chemistries of distant worlds. For that purpose, I have previously analyzed data from JWST, HST and Herschel of a variety of planets ranging from exoplanets smaller than Neptune to Jupiter and the Ultra-Hot Jupiter WASP-121 b.
